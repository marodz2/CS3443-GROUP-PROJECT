Short description of app: A vintage-like, 90s styled theme game like the ones that are commonly seen in bargain bins at local supermarkets. This app features 4 popular card games that are easy to play: Blackjack, Hearts, War, and Concentration.

Known bugs: In the Concentration game, clicking on a subsequent card in under 500ms sometimes leaves a previous card visible rather than removing it. In Hearts if there is a tie then both players are declared winners and sometimes it gives a null pointer exception if you pick cards too fast.
In War the original intent was to make the cards change based off what was on the top of each playerâ€™s deck, and instead it just prints. Finally, in Blackjack there are issues when either person draws more than 7 cards and sometimes when they both draw the 4 or 9 of diamonds.
